# Application Release Backlog

## Release 6.1.0 - 2025/xx/xx
* **Summary**: This release corresponds to the update of the collaborations analysis with the developpement of the statistics per institution of affiliations of the authors.
* **Features**:
  - Feature 1: Creation of "build_pub_addresses" module for building information on collaborating institutions with the Institute by parsing author addresses.
  - Feature 2: Creation of "build_institutions_stat" module allowing to build several statistics data for each type of institutions.
  - Feature 3: Update of the "coupling_analysis" module to integrate the use of the above created modules.
* **Improvements**:

  - Improvement 2: Addition of "_enhance_homonyms_file" and "_set_otps_dept_affil" functions dedicated to setting standardized department affiliation of authors before OTPs attribution.
  - Improvement 3: Update of "create_archi "function to automatically create useful folders for saving corpus extractions.
  - Improvement 4: Update of "save_otps" function to automatically create an empty file that will contain the OTPs attributed by the user if it not exists.
  - Improvement 5: Substitution of "_append_df" function by "concat_dfs" function to avoid warnings due to concatenation of empty dataframes using "concat" method of "pandas" library.
  - Improvement 6: Addition of "keep_initials" function  to avoid interpretation of first-name initials equal to NA as NaN.
  - Improvement 7: Redistribution of "merge_pub_employees" module into 3 modules for sake of clarity (new modules: "build_year_pub_empl" and "create_hash_id").
  - Improvement 8: Addittion of management of last corpus year when it is not in available years of impact factors in "update_impact_factors" module.
  - Improvement 9: Enhancement of analysis modules by use of saved final results rather than available results in corpus-year folders in order to take into account corresponding datatype results.
  - Improvements 10: Addition of "doctypes_analysis" module to provide statistics of publications by journals, conference proceedings or books.
  - Improvements 11: Substitution of "impact_factors_analysis" module by "build_kpi" one for the sake of clarity.

  - None.
* **Known Issues**:
  - None.
* **API Changes**:
  - None.
* **Deprecated Features**:
  - Feature 1: "impact_factors_analysis" module has been suppressed and replaced by "build_kpi" new module.

  - Feature 2: Use of progress bars displaying data processing tasks in progress.
  - Feature 3: Complementary authors attributes to the Institute authors list.
  - Feature 4: Use of 'Insitute_Country_towns.xlsx' file to parse affiliations for the coupling analysis according to the selected Institute.
  - Feature 5: Set of ad-hoc rawdata in the working folder using an updated folder architecture based on 3 combination types of data.
* **Improvements**:
  - Improvement 1: Introduction of standardization of last names of authors and employees for better efficiency in similarity tests for merge of employees information in publications list and therfore get more efficient automatic reduction of orphan authors list.
